# NitroBLAST
NitroBLAST (name subject to change), is project under development. The web app aims to gather bioinformatic data (sequence allignment, predicted regulon membership, and gene expression) from nitrogen fixing cyanobacteria in one area and allow an interactive discovery process. The vision for the final version would allow the user to filter genes that have high homology compared to other nitrogen fixing cyanobacteria, have predicted regulatory motifs similar to other nitrogen fixing genes, and have expression patterns that closely follow other nitrogen fixation genes.
